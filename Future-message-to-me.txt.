What do you hope to be able to do in 6 months? In 6 months I hope to know things so well that I feel comfortable and confident with what I'm doing.
What are you struggling with now? With remembering things when there's a lot going on at once.
What do you want to remember? I want to remember everything I've done because things will be easier then.
